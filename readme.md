To generate the documentation html you will need `doxygen`
    - `sudo apt-get install doxygen`
    - Once installed you can then run the command `doxygen` in the root of the `sharpts` 
        - Doxygen will use the configfile 'Doxyfile' if found and a specific file is not given
        - To specify a custom config use `doxygen <filename>`
